# manTrack software
manTrack implements two convenient tools that can be used in manual particle finding in images (only ellipse finding is supported currently):
* Particle deleting - by clicking on the particle you want to delete in images;
* Manual finding - by hand-drawing the position and orientation.

Some other useful tools:
* Switching between color mode (of particle orientation) and mono mode

The main user interface is shown below, followed by some examples of use.
