# Tracking code for elliptic particles

This module is composed of a preprocessing routine and a postprocessing routine.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing now takes in an image that has been bandpass filtered, so that no long range viariation is present in the image. Then it does the following:
1. threshold
2. locate particles (using skimage.measure.regionprops)
3. save the thresholded images and the particle data file

## Postprocessing
Postprocessing takes in the particle data file generated by preprocessing routine. Then it does the following:
1. link the particle information into trajectories
2. calculate collision events (distance, collision angle and velocity)
