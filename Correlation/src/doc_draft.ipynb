    "\n",
    "- This notebook contains finalized code for making the figures in the giant number fluctuations paper. Only two purposes of code should be kept: summary (summarizes batch data into a more condensed form) and plot (read data from data_summary spreadsheet, the sheet should locate in Google Drive\\corresponding research project folder\\data\\data_summary.xlsx).\n",
    "- Different figures will be organized under different sections (h2 title). Subfigures (panels) will be under subsections (h3 title). Each subsection should be self-complete, except importing packages.\n",
    "- Ideas and plans that haven't been implemented should be listed in the **Plan** block."
